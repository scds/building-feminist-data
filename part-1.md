## How does a computer understand language?

<iframe height="420" width="640" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 src="https://echo360.ca/media/dd213ce5-21f3-4e65-b771-1178c2033e45/public?autoplay=false&automute=false"></iframe>

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this video, participants will be able to... 
	
	1. Explain how language exists in digital spaces 

### Discussion Prompts

	1. Computers are extraordinarily literal. If code is misspelled, for example, then computers will not be able to understand. How does this impact how computers understand language? What is the difference between conversational and literal language?  
	2.     How would you breakdown and describe the meaning of a contextual or qualifying statement? For example, how might a computer understand statements related to weather? What does it mean to say ‘it’s warm” or it’s ‘bright and sunny?’ Think about the ways that you would need to define these terms explicitly to a computer.  
	3.     As you move through the next videos in this module, consider how feminist data challenges the ways that machines understand language. Sinders asks participants, “How do we fit [intersectional] feminism inside of a database? Is it possible? How do we take something that’s a broad ideology and break it down into components?
