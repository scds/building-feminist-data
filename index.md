# Creative Research and Building Feminist Data
<!--**A Relevant Research Series workshop prepared by [Juan Velasco](https://www.5wgraphics.com/en/about-us.php), Founder and Director of [5W Infographics](https://www.5wgraphics.com/).**-->

Caroline Sinders, an artist and researcher, explores the intersections of critical design, trauma, data, and artificial intelligence as art. In this workshop series, Sinders introduces the methodology she created to guide both her art and research practice: research driven art. Inspired by photojournalism, critical design, and open source software, this methodology is both a process and an approach to knowledge mobilization.

In the second session, Sinders explores data collection as both art and protest. Participants will collect feminist data after a brief introduction to machine learning, data, and design thinking. By treating data collection as a collaborative process, participants will create a feminist data set from the ground up, while also learning how data collection can be used as an artistic practice and a collaborative, community practice.

By the end of this workshop series, participants will be able to: 

1. Explain research driven art as a methodology and approach to knowledge mobilization

2. Engage in data collection as an artistic practice and as community practice

3. Create a dataset as part of a Feminist AI

Proceed to the [keynote](keynote) to get started.
