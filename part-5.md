### Step 1 (2 minutes)
1. Brainstorm different topics you are interested in that could potentially meet the criteria for inclusion in Feminist Data Set. Write out your ideas in a few words. You can do this as a word file, or use sticky notes. Try to separate your ideas as much as possible. Write as many ideas as possible.  

### Step 2 (2 minutes)
1. Pick one of the topics and add additional detail.  

### Step 3 (45-60 minutes)
1. Find a source that relates to the topic and that meets the criteria for the feminist data set. Remember, the Feminist Data Set features text-based resources. Examples include essays, blog posts, song lyrics, etc.  

### Step 4 (2 minutes)
1. Submit your contribution to Caroline Sinders csinders@gmail.com
